# Contributing to Kidney Cell Classification

We welcome contributions to the Kidney Cell Classification project! To maintain the quality of our code and ensure the project remains organized, we have set out these guidelines for contributions.

## Code Standards

- **PEP-8 Compliance**: All code contributions must strictly adhere to the [PEP-8 style guide](https://pep8.org/). This ensures consistency and readability of the codebase. We recommend using tools such as `flake8` or `pylint` to check your code for compliance before submitting.

## Making Contributions

### Forking the Project
To contribute, first, fork the repository. This is your own workspace where you can make your changes without affecting the main project.

### Setting Up Your Environment
After forking, clone the repository to your local machine and set up a virtual environment within the project directory:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```
followed by:
```
source venv/bin/activate # On Unix or MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows
```

Install the project dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Working on Your Contribution
Before you start working on a feature or a fix, it's a good idea to check the existing issues or open a new one to discuss your ideas. This ensures that your work aligns with the project's goals and that you are not duplicating someone else's efforts.

- **Opening an Issue**: Describe the feature, enhancement, or bug fix you propose. Provide as much detail as possible, outlining the value it adds to the project or the problem it solves.
- Reference this issue in your pull request later to provide context for your changes.

### Submitting a Pull Request (PR)
Once you have completed your work:
1. Push your changes to your fork.
2. Open a pull request to the main repository.
3. In your pull request description, reference the issue it addresses (if applicable). Provide a detailed overview of the changes and the reasoning behind them.
4. Ensure your code follows the PEP-8 standard and passes all existing tests.

## Thank You!
Your contributions help make our project better. We appreciate your efforts to improve the Kidney Cell Classification project!
